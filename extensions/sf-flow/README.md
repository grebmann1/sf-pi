# SF Flow

## What It Does

SF Flow is a lean lifecycle extension for Salesforce Flow metadata. It helps agents choose a general-purpose Flow family, inspect and diagnose local source, validate one exact Flow without saving it, run targeted Flow tests, and present graph structure as Mermaid-backed terminal diagrams.

Normal Pi `read`, `write`, and `edit` tools own source changes. SF Flow never deploys or activates a Flow.

## Core Flow Families

V1 provides authoring blueprints for:

1. Screen Flow
2. Autolaunched Flow
3. Record-Triggered Flow, including before-save, after-save, and before-delete timing
4. Schedule-Triggered Flow
5. Platform Event-Triggered Flow

Other Metadata API process and trigger values are reported as specialized. SF Flow can inspect their common graph shape but does not claim type-specific authoring proficiency for them.

## Lifecycle

Use the `sf_flow` family tool:

```text
status, org.preflight
project.scan, flow.inspect, author.plan, diagnose.file, quality.rules
fix.apply
validate.check
test.discover, test.plan, test.run, test.result, test.rerun
```

The intended loop is:

1. Run `author.plan` or `flow.inspect` to establish the Flow family and structure.
2. Edit `.flow-meta.xml` with normal Pi file tools.
3. Run `diagnose.file` until deterministic local findings are resolved. It returns the exact source version and any safe source-bound quick fixes.
4. Apply only a current `fix.apply` result when API version, Auto-Layout, or unused-variable cleanup is appropriate. Business logic remains with normal Pi edits.
5. Run `validate.check` against the intended org. This is a one-file Metadata API check-only operation and saves no metadata.
6. Run the smallest relevant targeted Flow test when an eligible Flow test exists in the org.

A successful local diagnosis does not establish deployment readiness. Salesforce check-only validation is the platform evidence boundary.

SF Flow does not own deployment or activation. If an external runtime proof temporarily activates a Flow, deploying a new Draft Flow version does not deactivate the existing active version. Cleanup must deploy `FlowDefinition` metadata with `<activeVersionNumber>0</activeVersionNumber>`, then verify `FlowDefinitionView.IsActive=false` and `ActiveVersionId=null`. For schedule-triggered Flows, also verify no matching `CronTrigger` remains. See [`AGENT_GUIDE.md`](./AGENT_GUIDE.md#temporary-activation-cleanup) for the exact metadata and runbook.

## Org-Grounded Authoring

`author.plan` remains local when `target_org` is omitted. With an explicit target, it performs bounded read-only grounding for:

- the requested object or platform event and intent-relevant fields;
- matching standard, Apex, Flow, external-service, and quick actions with input/output contracts;
- matching active or latest autolaunched subflows with input/output variables.

Each plan discloses API calls and grounding gaps. Results are bounded to prevent full-schema or full-action dumps, and no grounding occurs at startup or after ordinary file edits.

## Local Diagnostics

The small V1 analyzer reports source-located findings for:

- malformed XML or a non-Flow root;
- missing core metadata and inconsistent core family/trigger configuration;
- duplicate element or resource names;
- missing or dangling connector targets and unreachable elements;
- unresolved local references and invalid record context;
- database operations inside loops;
- missing fault paths, with Get Records treated as lower severity than mutation/action elements;
- elements that Salesforce documents as unavailable in before-save record-triggered flows.

Every analysis discloses skipped coverage. Broad formula, org-action, and project-wide analysis remains with Salesforce Code Analyzer.

The data-first rule catalog includes independent evaluators for all 30 published Lightning Flow Scanner rule concepts plus SF Pi-native correctness checks. Generation, review, and audit profiles keep policy-specific or noisy findings out of the automatic edit path. Use `quality.rules` to inspect the registry and [`QUALITY_RULES.md`](./QUALITY_RULES.md) for the full contract.

## Bounded Repair Loop

After a successful Flow file write or edit, SF Flow runs the low-noise generation profile. High and Moderate findings can steer at most three agent repair rounds. The loop stops when source is clean, the finding signature repeats, or the round limit is reached. It never performs hidden business-logic mutations.

`diagnose.file` can offer three deterministic fixes:

- set `apiVersion` to the SFDX project source version;
- add or correct `AUTO_LAYOUT_CANVAS` metadata;
- remove an exact unused local variable.

`fix.apply` requires the `fix_id` and SHA-256 `source_version` from the current diagnosis. It refuses stale source and re-diagnoses after writing.

## Flow Result Cards

Human-facing results use a normalized Flow Run Digest. Cards show:

- action outcome and target;
- Flow family, trigger, and object or event;
- local and API evidence rails;
- source-located findings or test failures;
- Mermaid-backed Flow topology;
- artifact paths and a next step.

The Result Card stays compact. SF Flow appends bounded topology as a top-level Mermaid block on the next final assistant message, so Pi renders it natively outside the tool tile and respects the user’s Mermaid setting. The displayed architecture uses verb-first nodes, labeled decision and loop edges, solid normal paths, thick paths into durable writes, and dotted fault paths for up to 100 executable elements, below Pi’s native 128-node Mermaid parser ceiling. Pi themes borders, node text, edges, arrowheads, and edge labels by semantic class. SF Flow intentionally avoids browser-only Mermaid `classDef`, `style`, per-node colors, and Markdown bold in labels because Pi’s terminal renderer ignores them. Relevant resource details are folded into their operation node; raw resources are not separate boxes. When the displayed graph is bounded, the `.mmd` Flow Artifact contains the complete executable topology.

## Safety and Data Boundaries

- No startup org probes, project scans, subprocesses, or network calls.
- Automatic post-edit feedback is local-only, bounded to three actionable rounds, and stays silent for clean files.
- `fix.apply` is limited to source-bound API-version, Auto-Layout, and unused-variable fixes and participates in Pi's file mutation queue.
- `validate.check` stages one Flow in a temporary directory with `checkOnly=true`; it never deploys or activates.
- Test runs require explicit Flow API names or Flow test names and never default to all tests.
- Complete evidence is persisted under `<globalAgentDir>/sf-pi/sf-flow/`; model-facing output stays compact.
- No Flow execution, deployment, activation, full-screen editor, LSP, VS Code package, or AI-backed generation service is included in V1.

## Live E2E Evidence

The E2E harness has passed against a connected non-production org at API 67.0: org preflight, clean local diagnosis, one-file Metadata API check-only validation, FlowTest metadata discovery, queued targeted `test.run`, and polled `test.result` completion.

A dedicated public-safe draft autolaunched Flow and FlowTest fixture is available under `scripts/e2e/fixtures/sf-flow/`. Provisioning always performs check-only first and requires an explicit `--deploy` flag. The fixture creates no data records and requires no activation.

The same project also contains public-safe Screen, schedule-triggered, platform-event-triggered, before-delete, and after-save fixtures plus one non-committing after-save FlowTest. Run `npm run e2e:sf-flow-families -- --org <non-production-alias>` for local diagnosis and combined check-only validation. Add `--deploy` to deploy Draft fixtures, deactivate any fixture left active through `FlowDefinition.activeVersionNumber=0`, run and rerun the after-save FlowTest, and verify inactive state, scheduled-job cleanup, and zero Account/Task residue.

Advanced public-safe fixtures live under `scripts/e2e/fixtures/sf-flow-advanced/`. Run `npm run e2e:sf-flow-advanced -- --org <dedicated-non-production-alias>` for local diagnosis and combined check-only validation, `--deploy` to retain inactive Draft Flow and Apex fixtures, or `--runtime` to temporarily activate the Flow fixtures and run targeted Apex integration tests. The runtime sweep covers Create, Update, Create or Update, and Delete trigger configurations; AND, OR, custom, and formula entry criteria; every `FlowRecordFilter` operator, collectively spanning string, currency, date, picklist, boolean, and reference fields; before-save, immediate after-save, related-record, and asynchronous-after-commit paths; and 1- and 200-record transactions. Element proofs include Assignment, Decision, Loop, Custom Error, Apex and standard Send Email actions, Subflow, Transform, Collection Filter and Sort, and Get, Create, Update, and Delete Records. It also proves `$Record__Prior`, invocable Apex cardinality/order, primitive and record-collection Subflow contracts, schedule-triggered batches, and 200-event platform-event execution. Runtime paths cover no-trigger autolaunched, before-save, after-save, before-delete, schedule-triggered, and platform-event Flows. Screen runtime remains outside this headless sweep. The harness uses a real committed transaction and bounded poll for asynchronous-after-commit evidence because Apex tests do not execute that path. Cleanup runs in `finally`, deactivates every Flow with `activeVersionNumber=0`, removes bounded fixture data and scheduled jobs, and verifies zero Account, Contact, Opportunity, Task, and CronTrigger residue.

The actual wide and 48-column Result Cards were rendered through the production component. Both remain bounded without embedding topology; long metadata and artifact paths use compact headers and hanging indentation. Hook tests prove the Mermaid block is appended once to the next final assistant message for Pi-native rendering.

To remove the dedicated fixture later, delete `FlowTest:SfPi_Flow_Test_Fixture_Happy_Path` followed by `Flow:SfPi_Flow_Test_Fixture` from the chosen non-production org.

SF Flow's quality-rule design is informed by the public rule documentation and black-box behavior of [Lightning Flow Scanner](https://lightningflowscanner.org/), an [MIT-licensed open-source project](https://github.com/Flow-Scanner/lightning-flow-scanner). SF Flow is an independent white-room implementation and does not include Lightning Flow Scanner production source code.

The exact upstream core package is pinned as a dev-only parity oracle. Fresh SF Pi fixtures compare rule occurrence and applicability without copying implementation, messages, regexes, or upstream example flows. See [`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](./THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).
